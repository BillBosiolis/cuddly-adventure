Angular is a popular open-source web application framework developed by Google. It's used for building single-page applications (SPAs) and dynamic web apps. Angular uses TypeScript as its primary language and offers features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a modular architecture, making it a comprehensive framework for front-end development.

### Usages
Angular has only been used in some PoCs and prototypes. It's not used in any production projects at the moment. There are some plans though to test in some of the production projects like GDM Database and GDM Replay.
