Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their software. It is primarily used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). Jenkins supports various Version Control Systems like Git, Subversion, and Mercurial, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven, and sbt based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.

Key features of Jenkins include:

- Easy installation: Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, macOS, and other Unix-like operating systems.
- Extensible: Jenkins can be extended via its plugin architecture, providing nearly infinite possibilities for what Jenkins can do.
- Distributed builds: Jenkins can distribute build/test loads to multiple computers with different operating systems.
- Easy configuration: Jenkins can be easily set up and configured using its web interface, which includes error checks and a built-in help function.
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery: In a nutshell, Jenkins allows you to continuously deliver your software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.
