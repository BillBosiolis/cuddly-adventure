Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

In other words, IaC is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. The IT infrastructure meant by this comprises both physical equipment such as bare-metal servers as well as virtual machines and associated configuration resources.

The definitions may be in a version control system. It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative approaches.

IaC approaches are promoted for cloud computing, which is sometimes marketed as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). IaC supports IaaS, but should not be confused with it.
