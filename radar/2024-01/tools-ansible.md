Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. It provides large productivity gains to a wide variety of automation challenges. Ansible uses a simple syntax written in YAML called playbooks which allows you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.

### Usages
