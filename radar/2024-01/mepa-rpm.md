RPM (RPM Package Manager) is a package management system used by Red Hat and its derivatives such as CentOS and Fedora. The name RPM refers to the following:  
The .rpm file format, files in the .rpm file format, software packaged in such files, and the package manager program itself.
RPM is a recursive acronym which stands for "RPM Package Manager".
RPM packages consist of an archive of files, along with metadata used for installing, uninstalling, and querying the package.
RPM is used to install, uninstall, upgrade, query, and verify packages. It maintains a database of installed packages and their files, so it can avoid overwriting files that were changed manually, and can verify the integrity of the installed packages.
