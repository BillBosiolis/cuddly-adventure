Mockito is a popular mocking framework that can be used in conjunction with testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG. It simplifies the process of creating mock objects in automated unit tests for the purpose of Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior Driven Development (BDD). Mockito allows you to write tests with a clean and simple API, giving you powerful verification and stubbing capabilities.
