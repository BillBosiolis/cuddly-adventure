Flask-WTF is an extension for Flask that integrates the WTForms library with Flask. It provides a simple interface for creating and validating forms in Flask applications, and includes features such as CSRF protection and file upload handling.

Flask-WTF forms are defined in Python code, and can then be rendered in your templates. This allows you to handle user input in a structured and secure way, with built-in validation and protection against common web attacks.
