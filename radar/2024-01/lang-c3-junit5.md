JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit, a widely used testing framework for Java applications. It is designed to be more modern and flexible than its predecessor, JUnit 4, and introduces several new features and improvements.

JUnit 5 is composed of several different modules from three different sub-projects:

- JUnit Platform: This is the foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM. It defines the TestEngine API for developing a testing framework that runs on the platform.

- JUnit Jupiter: This is the combination of the new programming model and extension model for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5. The Jupiter sub-project provides a TestEngine for running Jupiter based tests on the platform.

- JUnit Vintage: This provides a TestEngine for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 based tests on the platform.
