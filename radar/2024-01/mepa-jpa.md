Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and a relational database. JPA is a part of the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) specification and provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) approach to handle the critical task of data persistence in Java applications.

JPA allows developers to map, store, update and retrieve data from relational databases to Java objects and vice versa. It provides a way to map Java objects to database tables and to convert from database data to Java objects.

JPA includes features such as:

- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) capabilities.
- A flexible and powerful query language (JPQL) which is an extension of SQL.
- A Criteria API for creating typesafe queries.
- Support for stored procedures and native SQL queries.
- Caching mechanisms to improve application performance.
- Lifecycle management of entities.
