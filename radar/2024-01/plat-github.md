GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

Key features of GitHub include:

- Repository hosting: GitHub provides a remote location to store, manage, track, and control changes to your code.
- Pull requests: This feature allows developers to propose changes to a codebase. Other team members can review, discuss, and approve these changes.
- Issue tracking: GitHub provides a simple issue tracker that lets you manage bugs, tasks, and feature requests directly from your project's repository.
- GitHub Actions: This feature allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository.
- GitHub Pages: This feature allows you to host a static website directly from your repository.
- Integration with third-party tools: GitHub integrates with many tools like Jira, Jenkins, and many more, providing a comprehensive development ecosystem.

### Usages
There is a PoC in progress to test GitHub and GitHub Actions as there are plans to migrate to that platform.
