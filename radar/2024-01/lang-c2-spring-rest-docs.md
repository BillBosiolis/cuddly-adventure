Spring REST Docs is a project that helps you to document RESTful services. It combines hand-written documentation written with Asciidoctor and auto-generated snippets produced with Spring MVC Test. This approach frees you from the limitations of the documentation produced by tools like Swagger. It helps you to produce documentation that is accurate, concise, and well-structured. This documentation then allows your users to understand quickly how to use your RESTful service.
