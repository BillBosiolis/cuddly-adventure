Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM. It's used to create systems that are easily scalable and can handle high levels of traffic. Akka uses the Actor Model to raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and parallel systems.

### Usages
