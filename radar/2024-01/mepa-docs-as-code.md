Documentation as Code is a practice where the documentation is treated in the same way as code. This means that it is written in a format that can be read both by humans and machines, version controlled, tested, and built automatically.  

In this approach, documentation is usually written in lightweight markup languages like Markdown or AsciiDoc, which are easy to write and read in their raw form, but can also be easily converted into other formats like HTML or PDF.  

The benefits of Documentation as Code include:
- Version control: Changes to the documentation can be tracked over time, and it's easy to match the documentation to different versions of the software. 
- Collaboration: Developers can contribute to the documentation using the same tools and workflows they use for code. 
- Automation: The process of building and deploying the documentation can be automated, ensuring that the documentation is always up-to-date.

### Usages
A PoC is currently being conducted to use Documentation as Code. Once, the product to be used is agreed, the documentation will be written in that format. The documentation will be version controlled and built automatically using CI/CD pipelines.
