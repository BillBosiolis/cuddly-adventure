Spring Framework is a powerful, lightweight application framework designed for the Java platform. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust Java applications very easily and rapidly. Spring Framework was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.

The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Spring Framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model.
