OkHttp is an open-source HTTP client for Java applications. It's efficient, allowing synchronous and asynchronous network requests to be made. OkHttp also supports HTTP/2 and SPDY protocols, allows connection pooling, follows redirects, and can recover from network problems. It can also cache responses to avoid re-fetching data, and it integrates with Java's built-in URLConnection API.
