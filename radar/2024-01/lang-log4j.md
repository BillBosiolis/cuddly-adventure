JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. It plays a crucial role in the development of test-driven development, and is a family of testing frameworks which can be used in a wide range of testing scenarios. JUnit promotes the idea of "first testing then coding", which emphasizes on setting up the test data for a piece of code that can be tested first and then implemented.
