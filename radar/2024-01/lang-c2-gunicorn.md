Gunicorn, short for "Green Unicorn", is a Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) HTTP server. It is a pre-fork worker model, which means that it forks multiple worker processes to handle incoming requests. This makes it suitable for handling concurrent connections and allows it to utilize multiple processor cores.
