WireMock is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs. It allows you to stay productive when an API you depend on doesn't exist or isn't complete. It supports testing of edge cases and failure modes that the real API won't reliably produce. WireMock enables you to stub HTTP APIs, which means you can simulate the API or the backend system. It also allows you to verify that your code made the expected requests.
