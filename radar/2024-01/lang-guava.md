Google Guava is a set of open-source libraries for Java, developed by Google. It provides utility methods for collections, caching, primitives support, concurrency, common annotations, string processing, I/O, and validations. It also includes additional new collection types such as multiset, multimap, and bimap that aren't included in the standard Java collections.

Guava can help to reduce the amount of boilerplate code in your project, and provides powerful tools to make your code simpler and more readable.
