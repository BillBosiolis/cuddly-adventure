Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial or Git revision control systems. Bitbucket provides a central location to manage git repositories, view changes to the code base, and ensure that all the code works together.

Bitbucket supports pull requests, allowing developers to review code and discuss changes before integrating them into the main code base. It also integrates with other Atlassian software like JIRA, HipChat, Confluence, and Bamboo.

Key features of Bitbucket include:

- Private repositories: Bitbucket offers free unlimited private repositories, which are only visible to the team members you give access to.
- Pull requests and code reviews: Bitbucket supports pull requests, which are a way to discuss changes and review code before it's integrated into the main branch.
- Integrated Jira Software: Bitbucket is built for teams using Jira Software, providing full visibility linked between Jira issues and Bitbucket branches, commits, and pull requests.
- Built-in continuous delivery: Bitbucket Pipelines with built-in CI/CD allows you to automatically build, test, and even deploy your code based on a configuration file in your repository.
- Branch permissions: You can control who can commit to specific branches to protect your high-quality code.
