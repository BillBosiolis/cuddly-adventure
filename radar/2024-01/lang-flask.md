Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they want to use. This makes Flask very flexible and adaptable to many kinds of projects, but also means that the developer must make more decisions upfront compared to other frameworks.
