Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java. It can generate getters and setters for those object properties and can help to reduce the amount of boilerplate code. It provides annotations like @Getter, @Setter, @Data, @Builder, etc., which can be used to reduce the verbosity of Java code.
