Jackson is a Java-based library used for handling JSON. It provides functionality for reading and writing JSON, either to and from basic POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), or to and from a general-purpose JSON Tree Model (JsonNode), or to and from an event-based parser or generator. It's known for its high performance and flexibility.
