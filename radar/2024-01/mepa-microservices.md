Microservices, also known as the microservices architecture, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services, modeled around a business domain. Each microservice is self-contained and should implement a single business capability. They communicate with each other using APIs and can be independently deployed and scaled.

### Usages
The following services are built using the microservices architecture:
- GDM Replay Service
- GDM Metadata DB
- Bet Settings Uploader

A PoC for converting GDM SAPI to a microservice is currently in progress.
