Pytest is a testing framework for Python that allows you to easily create small, simple tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries. It is known for its powerful fixture model, which is a way to provide data, test doubles, or state setup to your tests. Pytest also supports parameterized testing, which allows you to run a test function multiple times with different arguments.
