Swagger is an open-source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. It's a powerful platform for designing APIs with a clean and elegant approach that saves a lot of time in the design and documentation phases of your API project. Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger.

### Usages
Swagger is used to generate automated REST API documentation that is always in sync with the code. For this purpose, the Sprint REST Templates are used. 

Examples can be found in:
- GDM Replay Service
- GDM Metadata database
