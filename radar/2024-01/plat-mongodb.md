MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc.

Key features of MongoDB include:

- Document-Oriented Storage: Data is stored in the form of JSON-like documents which can have varied structures.
- Indexing: You can index any attribute in a document to improve search performance.
- Replication: MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets which consists of two or more copies of the data.
- Auto-Sharding: It allows horizontal scaling by dividing data across many servers.
- Querying: It supports rich querying of data.
- Aggregation: It provides an aggregation framework based on the concept of data processing pipelines.
