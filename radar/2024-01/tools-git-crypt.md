Git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git repository. Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when committed, and decrypted when checked out. It is transparent to the user and can be used to protect sensitive data in a repository.

### Usages
Git-crypt was tested during the development of Bet Settings Uploader tool.
