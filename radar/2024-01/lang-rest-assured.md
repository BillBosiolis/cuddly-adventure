RestAssured is a Java library that provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing powerful, maintainable tests for RESTful APIs. With RestAssured, you can write tests in a BDD-style, making them easy to read and understand. It simplifies the process of validating and verifying responses from an API, handling everything from the HTTP request to the validation of the HTTP response.
