Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library for Python. It began as a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has evolved into one of the most advanced WSGI utility modules. It includes a powerful debugger, fully featured request and response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, and more.

Werkzeug can be used as a library for any existing WSGI application or as a basis for a new web framework. It's often used with Flask, as Flask's web server gateway interface.
