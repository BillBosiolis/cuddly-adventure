Google Guice (pronounced "juice") is a lightweight dependency injection framework for Java 6 and above, brought to you by Google. Dependency Injection is a design pattern whose core principle is to separate behavior from dependency resolution. Guice allows implementation classes to be programmatically bound to an interface, then allows the interface to be injected into constructors, methods or fields using an @Inject annotation. When more than one implementation of the same interface is needed, the user can create custom annotations that identify an implementation.
